== Requirements

Design and implement a RESTful API (including data model and the backing implementation) for
money transfers between accounts.

Explicit requirements:

    . You can use Java or Kotlin.
    . Keep it simple and to the point (e.g. no need to implement any authentication).
    . Assume the API is invoked by multiple systems and services on behalf of end users.
    . You can use frameworks/libraries if you like (except Spring), but don't forget about
      requirement #2 and keep it simple and avoid heavy frameworks.
    . The datastore should run in-memory for the sake of this test.
    . The final result should be executable as a standalone program (should not require a
      pre-installed container/server).
    . Demonstrate with tests that the API works as expected.

Implicit requirements:

    . The code produced by you is expected to be of high quality.
    . There are no detailed requirements, use common sense.
